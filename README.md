Simple Tool to Backup your Dark Souls Games Savegames (I, I Remastered, II and III)

Hey there,

after reading about all the problems that some cheaters in Dark Souls 3 cause I got a bit scared. If you have missed it as sticky topics look a bit like advertising, go ahead and read through it right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4h5n7z/psa_the_facts_information_and_what_you_can_do_to/).

So, I went ahead and built a complete tool for backing up all of your Souls games.

Simply start it and hit the big fat backup button. The Tool will automatically search for your DS savegames and back them up into a single folder (yes, you may specify which folder, for example dropbox and stuff). You can also backup your saves every X minutes (also free to configure), and you may keep X versions of your backups (also free to configure).

This tool does not manipulate any of your files, it just takes the savegames and zips them into a different folder. I didn't even implement recovering these files yet, but you can get to the savegame locations pretty fast by clicking on the relevant game title.

It will also only create backups if the original save file changed, so you wont get duplicates of your files.

* automatic backups
* configurable timer
* configurable amount of backups stored
* configurable destination folder
* pretty small (less than 1mb) and very light footprint
